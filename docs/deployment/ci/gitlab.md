# GitLab CI/CD

This guide explains how to set up **automatic deployments** using GitLab CI/CD - so that every time you merge a change to your main branch, your pricing pipeline is tested, deployed to staging, validated, and (with your approval) promoted to production.

!!! tip "New to Git, merge requests, or CI/CD?"
    This page assumes you understand basic Git concepts like branches, commits, and merge requests. If these are unfamiliar, read [Before You Start](../before-you-start.md) first - it explains everything in plain English.

!!! tip "Not sure if this is the right page?"
    If you access your project on **gitlab.com** (or a company GitLab server), this is the right page. If it's on **github.com**, go to [GitHub Actions](github-actions.md). If it's on **dev.azure.com**, go to [Azure DevOps](azure-devops.md). If you're not sure, ask your IT team or tech lead: *"Where is our code repository hosted?"* They'll tell you GitHub, GitLab, or Azure DevOps.

!!! info "What is GitLab CI/CD?"
    GitLab CI/CD is GitLab's built-in automation tool. It runs scripts (called **pipelines**) in response to events in your [repository](../before-you-start.md#getting-your-project-ready-for-deployment) - like opening a merge request or pushing to the main branch. If your team uses GitLab instead of GitHub, this is your [CI/CD](../before-you-start.md#what-is-cicd) provider.

!!! note "Who does what on this page?"
    This page has **two parts**. As a pricing analyst, you only need to do **Step 2** (commit the pipeline file) and **Step 3** (test it). **Step 1** (adding CI/CD variables) is usually done by your IT team or tech lead - they have the credentials and know the GitLab UI. If you're setting this up yourself, Step 1 walks you through it, but it's perfectly fine to hand it to IT and say: *"Can you add these CI/CD variables to our GitLab project? Here's the `.env.example` file listing what's needed."*

## What Haute generates

When you run `haute init --ci gitlab`, Haute creates a single `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root of your repository. This file defines a pipeline with five **stages** that run in order:

| Stage | When it runs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `validate` | On merge requests and pushes to main | Lints, type-checks, tests, validates pipeline, dry-run deploy |
| `deploy-staging` | On push to main only | Deploys to a staging endpoint |
| `smoke-test` | After staging deploy | Scores test quotes against the live staging endpoint |
| `impact-analysis` | After smoke test | Compares new staging premiums vs current production |
| `deploy-production` | **Manual click** | Deploys to production after you've reviewed the impact report |

This gives you the same safe release pipeline as GitHub Actions:

```
Merge request → Validation → Merge → Staging → Smoke test → Impact analysis → [You review] → Production
```

---

## How it works, step by step

### 1. You make a change and open a merge request

You edit your pipeline, update a model, or change a configuration. You push your changes to a [branch](../before-you-start.md#1-create-a-branch) and open a **merge request** (MR) - GitLab's equivalent of a [pull request](../before-you-start.md#4-ask-for-a-review-pull-request). It's a way of asking your teammate to review your changes before they go live.

### 2. Validation runs automatically

The `validate` stage runs immediately on your merge request:

- **Lint & format** - checks your code style with `ruff`
- **Type check** - runs `mypy` to catch type errors
- **Tests** - runs `pytest`
- **Pipeline validation** - runs `haute lint` and `haute deploy --dry-run` to check your pipeline parses correctly and test quotes pass

If any of these fail, the MR gets a red ❌ and you can see what went wrong in the pipeline logs.

### 3. You merge to main

Once validation passes and your teammate has reviewed the MR, you [merge](../before-you-start.md#5-accept-the-changes-merge) it - which applies your changes to the main version of the project. This triggers the remaining stages.

### 4. Staging deployment (automatic)

The `deploy-staging` stage runs `haute deploy --endpoint-suffix "-staging"`, which creates a separate endpoint just for testing (e.g. `motor-pricing-staging`).

### 5. Smoke test (automatic)

The `smoke-test` stage runs `haute smoke --endpoint-suffix "-staging"`, scoring your test quotes against the live staging endpoint to make sure it's working.

### 6. Impact analysis (automatic)

The `impact-analysis` stage runs `haute impact --endpoint-suffix "-staging"`, comparing premiums from the new staging endpoint against the current production endpoint. The impact report is saved as a **pipeline artifact** you can download.

### 7. You review the impact report

Download the `impact_report.md` artifact from the pipeline. It shows you exactly what changed:

```
Output: technical_price
  Staging mean:     548.57     Production mean:   536.12
  Mean change:       +2.3%    Rows changed:      84.2%
  Max increase:     +18.7%    Max decrease:       -4.2%

  ⚠ 147 quotes changed by more than ±25.0%
  ✓ Average change (+2.3%) within ±10.0% threshold
```

### 8. You promote to production (manual)

If you're happy with the impact report, go to the pipeline in GitLab and click the **play button** ▶ on the `deploy-production` job. This is a **manual action** - it won't run until you explicitly click it.

The production job deploys to the real endpoint and tags the release in Git.

## Setup

### Step 1: Add your credentials as CI/CD Variables

!!! tip "This step is usually done by IT"
    If you're not comfortable navigating GitLab's settings, ask your IT team or tech lead to do this. Give them the `.env.example` file from your project - it lists exactly which variables are needed.

Your pipeline needs credentials to deploy. In GitLab, these are stored as **CI/CD Variables**.

1. Go to your project page in GitLab (e.g. `gitlab.com/yourcompany/motor-pricing`)
2. In the left sidebar, click **Settings** (the ⚙️ gear icon near the bottom) → **CI/CD**
3. Scroll down to the **Variables** section and click **Expand**
4. Click **Add variable** for each credential below:

**For Databricks:**

| Variable | Value | Options |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABRICKS_HOST` | Your workspace URL | Mask variable ✓ |
| `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` | Your personal access token | Mask variable ✓ |

**For Docker/Container targets:**

| Variable | Value | Options |
|---|---|---|
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | Your registry username | Mask variable ✓ |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | Your registry password | Mask variable ✓ |

**For AWS ECS:**

| Variable | Value | Options |
|---|---|---|
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | `AWS` | Mask variable ✓ |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | ECR auth token | Mask variable ✓ |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Your AWS access key | Mask variable ✓ |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your AWS secret key | Mask variable ✓ |
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | e.g. `eu-west-1` | - |

**For Azure Container Apps:**

| Variable | Value | Options |
|---|---|---|
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | Your ACR name | Mask variable ✓ |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | Your ACR password | Mask variable ✓ |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Your subscription ID | Mask variable ✓ |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Your tenant ID | Mask variable ✓ |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Your service principal app ID | Mask variable ✓ |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Your service principal secret | Mask variable ✓ |

!!! tip "Mask variable"
    Always tick **Mask variable** for secrets - this prevents them from appearing in pipeline logs.

!!! tip "Protect variable"
    Optionally tick **Protect variable** to restrict secrets to protected branches (like `main`). This means merge request pipelines can't access them, which is more secure.

### Step 2: Commit the pipeline file

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file was created by `haute init` in the root of your project. Make sure it's committed:

```powershell
git add .gitlab-ci.yml
git commit -m "Add GitLab CI/CD pipeline"
git push
```

### Step 3: Test it

1. Create a branch, make a small change, and open a merge request
2. Go to **Build** → **Pipelines** - the validation stage should start automatically
3. If it passes, merge the MR
4. Watch the full pipeline run - staging, smoke test, impact analysis
5. Click the ▶ play button on `deploy-production` when you're ready

## The generated pipeline in detail

!!! note "You don't need to read or understand the YAML below"
    The pipeline file was generated by `haute init` and works out of the box. The sections below are **reference only** - for troubleshooting or if your IT team wants to understand what’s happening.

??? info "`.gitlab-ci.yml` structure"

    ```yaml
    stages:
      - validate
      - deploy-staging
      - smoke-test
      - impact-analysis
      - deploy-production

    default:
      image: python:3.11
      cache:
        key: uv-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
        paths:
          - .cache/uv
      before_script:
        - pip install "uv>=0.5,<1" && uv sync --frozen
    ```

??? info "Key features"

    - **Caching** - `uv` packages are cached between runs so installs are fast after the first time
    - **`resource_group: deploy`** - staging, smoke, impact, and production jobs use the same resource group, which prevents two deploys from running at the same time
    - **`when: manual`** - the production job requires a manual click, so you always review before going live
    - **`allow_failure: false`** - the manual production job blocks the pipeline from showing as “passed” until you run it (so you don’t forget)
    - **Artifacts** - the impact report is uploaded as a pipeline artifact you can download from the GitLab UI

??? info "Stage details"

    | Stage | Command | Timeout |
    |---|---|---|
    | validate | `ruff check .`, `mypy .`, `pytest -v`, `haute lint`, `haute deploy --dry-run` | 10 min |
    | deploy-staging | `haute deploy --endpoint-suffix "-staging"` | 15 min |
    | smoke-test | `haute smoke --endpoint-suffix "-staging"` | 10 min |
    | impact-analysis | `haute impact --endpoint-suffix "-staging"` | 10 min |
    | deploy-production | `haute deploy` + git tag | 15 min |

## GitLab vs GitHub - key differences

If you're used to the GitHub Actions setup, here's how GitLab differs:

| Concept | GitHub | GitLab |
|---|---|---|
| Config file | `.github/workflows/*.yml` (multiple files) | `.gitlab-ci.yml` (single file) |
| Credentials | Repository Secrets | CI/CD Variables |
| Pull request | Pull request | Merge request |
| Manual approval | Separate workflow + "Run workflow" button | `when: manual` on a job + ▶ play button |
| Artifacts | Upload/download actions | Built-in `artifacts:` keyword |
| Parallel jobs | Separate `jobs:` in a workflow | Separate jobs in the same `stage:` |

---

## Working solo?

If you're the only person on the team:

1. Set `min_approvers = 0` in `haute.toml` under `[safety.approval]`
2. You still get the full pipeline - validation → staging → smoke test → impact analysis
3. Click the ▶ play button yourself after reviewing the impact report

---

## Troubleshooting

### Pipeline doesn't trigger

- **On MR:** Make sure the MR targets the `main` branch
- **On merge:** Check the pipeline ran - go to **Build** → **Pipelines**
- **Pending:** If the pipeline is stuck on "pending", your GitLab instance may not have available runners. Check **Settings** → **CI/CD** → **Runners**

### "Variable is not set" or "Authentication failed"

Your CI/CD variables are missing or misnamed:

1. Go to **Settings** → **CI/CD** → **Variables**
2. Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. If you ticked "Protect variable", make sure the job runs on a protected branch

### Deploy job can't access credentials

If validation passes but deploy-staging fails with auth errors, your variables might be **protected**. Protected variables are only available on protected branches (like `main`). Since the deploy stages only run on `main`, this should work - but double-check your branch is protected in **Settings** → **Repository** → **Protected branches**.

### "No runners available"

Your GitLab instance needs **runners** - machines that execute the pipeline. If you're on GitLab.com, shared runners are available by default. For self-hosted GitLab, ask your IT team to set up a runner or enable shared runners.

### Impact report not appearing

The impact report is saved as a pipeline artifact. To download it:

1. Go to the pipeline → click the `impact-analysis` job
2. On the right side, click **Browse** under **Job artifacts**
3. Download `impact_report.md`
