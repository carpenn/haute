# Commit Standards

Every commit merged into `main` must satisfy the checks below. Review this list during code review and before approving a PR.

---

## Design Philosophy

These are the non-negotiable principles that shape every decision in haute. If a commit conflicts with any of these, it needs rethinking.

### Code is the source of truth

The `.py` file is always canonical. The GUI is a live, editable *view* of that code - never the other way around. Layout metadata lives in a sidecar `.haute.json`, not in the Python. A pipeline must always be runnable with `python main.py` - no GUI required.

### Same pipeline, every context

The same pipeline code runs for a 1-row live API quote and a 100M-row batch job. No separate "live mode" vs "batch mode" implementations. If a node works in preview, it works in production.

### Single execution engine

CLI, GUI, and programmatic usage all flow through the same parser → executor path. There is one topo sort, one graph executor, one code generator. Parallel implementations drift and break.

### Polars-native, lazy by default

All intermediate results stay as `LazyFrame` until the moment data is needed. This lets Polars push predicates and limits into scans. Never call `.collect()` earlier than necessary. Never convert to pandas.

### The GUI never crashes

Bad code in a `.py` file shows an error banner, not a white screen. Parse errors, execution errors, and malformed data are all caught and surfaced gracefully. The last known good state is always preserved.

### Permissive parsing, strict generation

The parser accepts messy, hand-edited Python - regex fallback, partial decorators, missing type hints. The code generator always emits clean, idiomatic, `ruff`-passing Python. Round-tripping through the GUI improves code quality.

### Thin orchestration, not a platform

Haute is a client library that leans on Databricks, MLflow, and Polars. It does not reimplement model training, data storage, or serving infrastructure. New integrations should wrap existing tools, not replace them.

### Performance is non-negotiable

The GUI must feel instant. Every change — adding nodes, dragging, connecting edges, undo/redo — must complete without perceptible lag, even with large pipelines. Backend calls (preview, run) are inherently async, but the UI thread must never block on them. Specific rules:

- **No unnecessary re-renders.** Memoize components, callbacks, and derived data (`memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`). Never create new objects/arrays in render that could be stable references.
- **No unnecessary network calls.** Don't fetch preview data on multi-select, drag, or any interaction where the user isn't asking for data. Batch where possible.
- **Keep the history stack cheap.** Undo/redo snapshots are plain JSON references, not deep clones. Position-only drags batch into a single snapshot, not one per pixel.
- **Lazy by default.** Polars `LazyFrame` stays lazy until the last moment. Preview limits rows. Large datasets never load fully into the frontend.
- **Profile before optimising.** Don't add complexity for hypothetical performance. But if a real interaction feels slow, fix it before shipping.

### Low floor, high ceiling

A pricing analyst with no engineering background can drag nodes and connect them in the GUI. A senior engineer can write raw Polars expressions, custom decorators, and deploy via CI/CD. Both use the same tool. Features should serve the analyst by default and get out of the engineer's way.

### Everything is diffable

Pipeline logic is `.py` files - reviewable in PRs, diffable in git, testable in CI. Node positions are JSON. There are no opaque binary formats. If it can't be diffed, it shouldn't be committed.

### Explain every price

Every output value must be traceable back through the graph to its inputs, showing the intermediate value at each node. This is a regulatory requirement (Solvency II, IFRS 17) and a core product differentiator. Features that break traceability are not acceptable.

## Engineering Standards

## 1. No Duplication (DRY)

- No copy-pasted logic. If two places do the same thing, extract a shared function/module.
- Shared utilities live in well-known locations (`graph_utils.py`, `frontend/src/utils/`).
- Shared constants (e.g. config key tuples used by both parser and codegen) live in `_types.py` alongside the TypedDict they describe, and are re-exported through `graph_utils.py`.
- Frontend and backend implementations of the same logic (e.g. `sanitizeName`) must reference each other in comments and stay in sync.

## 2. Simplicity (KISS)

- Prefer the simplest solution that works. No premature abstractions.
- If a function takes more than 5 parameters, consider a config object or breaking it up.
- Avoid clever one-liners that sacrifice readability.

## 3. Single Responsibility

- Each module, class, and function does one thing.
- API endpoints are thin - validation and response shaping only. Business logic lives in the library layer (`executor.py`, `pipeline.py`, etc.).
- React components: rendering only. Side effects in hooks, logic in utils.

## 4. Type Safety

- **Python**: All function signatures have type annotations. No `Any` unless truly unavoidable.
- **Python API**: Every endpoint uses Pydantic request/response models. No `body: dict`.
- **TypeScript**: No `any`. Use proper interfaces/types for all props, state, and API responses.
- **PEP standards**: The codebase uses PEP 563 (`from __future__ import annotations` in every `.py` file), PEP 585 (`list`, `dict`, `tuple` — not `List`, `Dict`, `Tuple`), and PEP 604 (`str | None` — not `Optional[str]`).
- **Pydantic field conventions**: Optional primitives use `str | None = None`. Mutable defaults use `Field(default_factory=dict)` or `Field(default_factory=list)`. Numeric defaults are inline: `float = 0.0`, `int = 0`.

## 5. Linter Clean

- `ruff check src/haute/` must pass with zero errors before merge.
- Frontend must have no TypeScript errors (`tsc --noEmit`).
- New ruff rules are not silenced without a comment explaining why.

## 6. No Dead Code

- No unused imports, variables, or functions.
- No commented-out code blocks. Use version control to retrieve old code.
- No empty files. If a file has no content, delete it.

## 7. No Stale Documentation

- If you change behaviour, update the relevant doc in `docs/`.
- If you add, remove, or rename a deploy target, CLI command, or user-facing feature, update both `README.md` and `docs/index.md` to match.
- `README.md` is the first thing people read. Deploy target tables, architecture tables, and the "what runs where" summary must reflect the current code.
- Status tables in design docs must reflect reality (no "❌ Missing" for things that exist).
- README examples must actually run.

## 8. Dependency Discipline

- No heavy optional dependencies in core `[project.dependencies]`. Use `[project.optional-dependencies]`.
- Pin minimum versions, not exact versions.
- Every new dependency must be justified in the PR description.

## 9. No Resource Leaks

- File handles: use `with` statements or `subprocess.DEVNULL`. Never `open()` without close.
- Async tasks: always cancellable. Use lifespan context managers, not `on_event`.
- WebSocket connections: always cleaned up in `finally` blocks.

## 10. Single Execution Path

- CLI and GUI must use the same execution engine (`parse → execute_graph`).
- No parallel implementations of the same algorithm (e.g. two topo sorts).
- If a code path is only reachable from one caller, consider inlining it.

## 11. Correct Data Structures

- Use `deque` for FIFO, not `list.pop(0)`.
- Use `set` for membership checks, not list scans.
- Use lazy evaluation (Polars `LazyFrame`) until the moment you need concrete data.

## 12. Error Handling

- Never swallow exceptions silently (`except: pass`).
- The same applies to frontend code: `.catch(() => {})` is the TypeScript equivalent of `except: pass`. Always log with `console.warn` at minimum.
- API errors return structured JSON with status codes, not bare strings.
- `HTTPException` and other intentional error responses must be raised **outside** generic `try/except Exception` blocks. Otherwise the framework exception is caught and re-wrapped as a 500.
- The GUI never crashes due to bad data. Worst case: show last good state + error banner.

## 13. Consistent Naming

- Python: `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes.
- TypeScript: `camelCase` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for components/types.
- API fields that cross the frontend/backend boundary use `snake_case` (Python convention). Since we own both frontend and backend, one convention everywhere avoids alias machinery and translation layers.

## 14. Idiomatic React

- No module-level mutable state. Use `useRef` for instance-scoped counters.
- Side effects only in `useEffect` or event handlers.
- Memoize expensive computations with `useMemo`/`useCallback`.
- Prefer controlled components.

## 15. Security Basics

- No hardcoded secrets or API keys. Use environment variables.
- File access endpoints must validate paths stay within the project root. Use `_get_project_root()` from `haute._sandbox`, resolve the path, and check with `.startswith()`:

```python
from haute._sandbox import _get_project_root

base = _get_project_root()
target = (base / user_path).resolve()
if not str(target).startswith(str(base)):
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Cannot save outside project root")
```

- Path validation must include a test that verifies traversal paths like `../../etc/passwd` are rejected with 403.
- No `eval()` on untrusted input. User code execution is sandboxed to pipeline context.
- Sensitive internal docs (competitive analysis, credentials) must be in `.gitignore`.

## 16. Test Coverage

- New business logic must include at least one test.
- Bug fixes must include a regression test.
- Tests must not depend on external services or network access.
- Never delete or weaken an existing test without explicit justification in the PR.

## 17. Commit Hygiene

- Each commit is atomic: one logical change per commit.
- Commit messages follow conventional format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`.
- No generated files (`node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, build output) in commits.

## 18. Design Before Code

- Changes that touch more than 3 files, change a public API, or introduce a new subsystem require a short design doc in `docs/` *before* implementation begins.
- The doc does not need to be long. A few paragraphs covering **problem**, **approach**, **alternatives considered**, and **open questions** is sufficient.
- The purpose is to catch bad designs before they become 2,000 lines of code. A 20-minute doc saves a week of rework.
- Trivial changes (rename, bug fix, test addition) do not need a doc.

## 19. 

- Solutions are as elegant as possible and not overly engineered

## 20. Canonical Data Types

- Structured data that flows between modules must use **Pydantic `BaseModel`**, not plain dicts. Dicts provide no validation, no autocomplete, and no documentation. Attribute access (`node.data.nodeType`) is explicit; dict access (`node["data"]["nodeType"]`) is opaque.
- The canonical graph types live in `_types.py`: `NodeData`, `GraphNode`, `GraphEdge`, `PipelineGraph`. All internal code passes these models. Use `.model_dump()` only at serialization boundaries (JSON files, API responses).
- Use `.model_validate(d)` to convert incoming dicts (e.g. from JSON) to models at the earliest opportunity. Do not pass raw dicts through multiple function calls.
- If you find code accessing a Pydantic model with `["key"]` syntax or `.get()`, that is a bug.

## 21. Minimal API Surface

- Every public function, class, and constant is a maintenance promise. Prefix internal helpers with `_` (e.g. `_build_edges`, `_sanitize_func_name`).
- `__init__.py` re-exports should be deliberate. Only export what external consumers need. Do not re-export everything from submodules.
- If a function is only called from one module, consider whether it belongs in that module rather than in a shared utility file.
- Before adding a new public function, check whether an existing function can be extended to cover the use case.

## 22. Test Quality

- **Deterministic.** Tests must not depend on wall-clock time, random seeds, filesystem ordering, or network. Flaky tests erode trust and get ignored.
- **Fast.** The full suite should run in under 10 seconds. If a test needs heavy I/O, use `tmp_path` with minimal data. Never load production-scale data in tests.
- **Focused.** Each test verifies one behaviour. If a test name needs "and" in it, split it into two tests.
- **Independent.** Tests must not depend on execution order. No shared mutable state between tests. Use fixtures, not module-level setup.
- **Readable.** A test is documentation. The arrange/act/assert structure should be obvious. Use helper functions (e.g. `_make_graph`, `_n`, `_g`) to keep test bodies short and intention-clear.
- Prefer **real objects** over mocks. Mock external services and I/O; do not mock your own code unless there is no alternative.

## 23. Module Boundaries

- Imports flow **downward**: high-level modules import low-level modules, never the reverse. The dependency direction is: `cli` / `server` → `executor` / `codegen` / `deploy` → `parser` → `_types` / `_topo` / `graph_utils`.
- Circular imports are a design smell. If module A imports module B and module B imports module A, one of them has the wrong responsibility. Fix the design, do not paper over it with deferred imports (unless the circular dependency is genuinely at the type-checking level only).
- Each module should have a clear one-sentence purpose. If you cannot describe what a module does without "and", it may need splitting.
- Cross-module communication happens through well-defined types (`PipelineGraph`, `ResolvedDeploy`, `TraceResult`), not raw dicts or tuples.

## 24. Logging & Observability

Haute pipelines run in production serving environments (Databricks model serving, containerised endpoints). When something fails at 2am, logs are the only diagnostic tool. Good logging is not optional.

- **Use structlog, not `print`.** All runtime output goes through `structlog` via `from haute._logging import get_logger`. `print()` is for CLI user-facing output only (via `click.echo`). Never use `print` for diagnostic or debug information.
- **One logger per module.** Declare `logger = get_logger(component="module_name")` at module level. Do not pass logger objects between functions. The `component` kwarg identifies the source in JSON logs.

```python
from haute._logging import get_logger

logger = get_logger(component="parser")
```

- **Structured context via keyword arguments.** structlog logs are key-value pairs, not format strings. Include the identifiers a human needs to diagnose the problem.

```python
# BAD
logger.error("Node failed")
logger.error(f"Node {node_id} failed: {exc}")

# GOOD — structured, searchable, machine-parseable
logger.error("node_execution_failed", node_id=node_id, error=str(exc))
logger.info("pipeline_parsed", file=str(path), node_count=len(graph.nodes))
```

- **Correct log levels.**
  - `DEBUG` — internal state useful only when actively debugging (intermediate row counts, cache hits, topo sort order).
  - `INFO` — significant lifecycle events (pipeline parsed, deploy started, model logged to MLflow, graph executed).
  - `WARNING` — something unexpected that the system recovered from (fallback parser used, missing optional config, cache invalidated).
  - `ERROR` — something failed that the user needs to know about (node execution error, file not found, deploy rejected).
- **Every module that does work must have a logger.** Pure data-structure modules (`_types.py`) are exempt. Anything that parses, executes, deploys, validates, or does I/O needs logging at `INFO` level for lifecycle events and `ERROR` level for failures.
- **No logging in hot paths.** Do not log per-row or per-node-per-execution inside the executor loop. Log once at the start and once at the end with summary counts.
- **No sensitive data in logs.** Do not log file contents, DataFrame values, API keys, or user code. Log metadata (file paths, column names, row counts) only.
- **Errors carry context up.** When catching and re-raising, use `raise ... from exc` to preserve the chain. When logging an error, include the exception: `logger.exception("...")` or `logger.error("...", exc_info=True)`.

## 25. Background Job Pattern

Long-running operations (model training, optimisation solving) use a consistent pattern across route modules:

- **Job store**: `_jobs: dict[str, dict[str, Any]] = {}` at module level, keyed by a hex job ID from `os.urandom`.
- **TTL eviction**: `_evict_stale_jobs()` called at the start of the submit endpoint. Jobs older than `_JOB_TTL_SECONDS` (24h) are removed.
- **Thread dispatch**: The submit endpoint starts a `threading.Thread(target=_background_fn, daemon=True)` and returns `{"status": "started", "job_id": ...}` immediately.
- **Status polling**: A GET endpoint returns the job's current status, progress, and elapsed time. The result is included when status is `"completed"`.
- **Thin closures**: The thread target should be a thin dispatcher. Extract the actual work into module-level functions (e.g. `_solve_online`, `_solve_ratebook`) with explicit typed parameters so they are testable and readable.

New route modules that add background jobs must follow this same structure. See `routes/modelling.py` and `routes/optimiser.py` as reference implementations.

## 26. Formatted Lookup Tables

When a file contains an aligned lookup table (e.g. `NODE_TYPE_META` in `nodeTypes.ts`), new entries must match the column alignment of existing entries. Misaligned entries make diffs noisy and the table harder to scan.

---

## LLM-Generated Code: Watch For These

AI coding assistants produce plausible-looking code that often hides real problems. Every reviewer (human or AI) must check for these patterns specifically.

### Dangerous fallbacks that mask errors

```python
# BAD - silently returns empty data instead of crashing
def get_data(path):
    try:
        return pl.read_parquet(path)
    except Exception:
        return pl.DataFrame()  # caller has no idea it failed
```

- Never return a default value from a `catch` unless the caller explicitly expects it.
- Prefer letting exceptions propagate. If you must catch, log the error and re-raise or return a result type that signals failure.
- Watch for `or {}`, `or []`, `or ""` fallbacks that turn a bug into silent wrong data.

### Broad exception swallowing

- `except Exception: pass` is almost never correct. Catch the specific exception you expect.
- `except Exception as e: return {"error": str(e)}` in API endpoints is fine - but only at the outermost layer. Inner code should not catch broadly.

### Hallucinated APIs and parameters

- LLMs invent function signatures, config keys, and library methods that don't exist. Every API call, import, and parameter must be verified against the actual codebase or library docs.
- Watch for plausible-but-wrong Polars methods (e.g. `df.groupby()` instead of `df.group_by()`).

### Stale patterns from older library versions

- LLMs train on old code. Watch for deprecated patterns:
  - `@app.on_event("startup")` → use `lifespan` context manager
  - `from typing import List, Dict` → use `list`, `dict` (Python 3.11+)
  - `pd.DataFrame` when we use `pl.DataFrame`

### Defensive code that hides bugs

```python
# BAD - if node_map is missing a key, this silently skips it
result = node_map.get(nid, {}).get("data", {}).get("config", {})
```

- Chained `.get()` with default dicts makes `KeyError` impossible to diagnose. If the key should exist, access it directly and let it fail loudly.
- Only use `.get()` with defaults when the key is genuinely optional.

### Duplicated logic disguised as "safety"

- LLMs often generate a "just in case" check that duplicates logic already handled upstream. This creates two code paths that must be kept in sync.
- If a function already validates its input, don't re-validate it in the caller.

### Over-abstraction and premature generalisation

- LLMs love creating `BaseNode`, `NodeFactory`, `AbstractPipelineExecutor` hierarchies for code that has exactly one concrete implementation.
- If there's only one subclass, you don't need the base class.
- Prefer plain functions over class hierarchies until you have three concrete use cases.

### Comments that restate the code

```python
# BAD - the comment adds zero information
x = x + 1  # increment x by 1
```

- LLMs pad output with obvious comments. Comments should explain *why*, not *what*.
- Delete any comment that a competent reader could infer from the code itself.

### Untested edge cases presented as handled

- LLMs generate `if` branches for edge cases but don't test them. An untested branch is worse than no branch - it gives false confidence.
- If you add an edge case handler, add a test for it. If you can't test it, add a `# TODO: untested` comment.

### HTTPException swallowed by generic except

```python
# BAD - the 403 is caught and becomes a 500
try:
    if not str(target).startswith(str(base)):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Outside root")
    target.write_text(data)
except Exception as exc:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(exc))
```

- LLMs naturally place validation inside the same `try` block as the I/O. `HTTPException` inherits from `Exception`, so it gets caught and re-wrapped as a 500.
- Fix: move validation (and its `raise HTTPException`) **before** the `try` block.

### Frontend silent catches

```typescript
// BAD - TypeScript equivalent of except: pass
fetch(url).catch(() => {})

// GOOD - at minimum, log the failure
fetch(url).catch((e) => console.warn("request failed", e))
```

- LLMs generate `.catch(() => {})` to suppress Promise rejections. This hides network errors, auth failures, and API bugs.
- Always log with `console.warn` at minimum. If the catch updates state (e.g. clearing a list), still log the error.

### Import bloat

- LLMs import modules speculatively. If a function isn't used, the import shouldn't be there.
- Watch for `from typing import ...` lines that grow with every edit but never shrink.

## Backward Compatibility: None Required

This is a brand new application. Do not add compatibility shims, version checks, or migration code.

- **No "legacy" support** - if an API is poorly designed, change it. Do not keep the old version alongside the new one.
- **No feature flags** - if a feature is ready, ship it. Do not add `ENABLE_NEW_X` environment variables.
- **No versioned endpoints** - `/api/v1/` is unnecessary. Use `/api/` and evolve it as needed.
- **No migration scripts** - if the data model changes, update the code. There is no production data to migrate yet.
- **No deprecation warnings** - if something is wrong, remove it. Do not add `warnings.warn` with a future removal date.

The only exception is the public PyPI package interface (`haute` CLI and core APIs). Prioritize clean, simple code over compatibility gymnastics.
